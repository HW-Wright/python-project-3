# Python Monthly Budget
My third portfolio project uses Python code from the run.py file to read, retrive and update data in a Google Sheet. The primary purpose of the project is to both maintain a historical record of the user's spending in various areas, and present the user with an accurate change in spending from the previous month, in the form of a percentage. The program will have obvious use for the majority of people.
